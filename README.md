# Project 1: Event Accessibility Guide for People with Disabilities

## Problem Statement

# People with disabilities often struggle to find detailed, reliable information on venue accessibility. Many event organizers do not provide comprehensive accessibility details, leading to inconvenience and exclusion. This project aims to create an accessibility guide where users can check, review, and share information about venues' accessibility features.

=========================================================================

## Project Overview
### Requirements

● Frontend: Accessibility venue listings, user reviews, filter options, ratings.
● Backend: Database for venue details, user authentication, review system, image uploads.
=========================================================================

## Expected Deliverables
# Designer:

● UX research on accessibility needs.
● Wireframes and UI for venue listings, review submission, and fi ltering.
● Visual design with inclusive, accessibility-focused UI elements.
=========================================================================



## Developers:

● User authentication and profile management.
● Review and rating system implementation.
● Search and filter functionality for venue listings.
● Media upload for user-submitted accessibility images.
● Moderation tools for review approvals.
=========================================================================

# Additional Considerations

● Project Management: Each team should maintain a Linear board to track tasks, deadlines, and responsibilities.
● Version Control: All developers must use GitHub for proper code collaboration.
● Communication: Teams should actively use Slack or Discord to ensure seamless discussions.
● Documentation: Each project must include clear readme files, API documentation, and user guides to improve usability and maintainability.

# By the end of the program, teams should deliver a functional MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that demonstrates core features, with additional refinements based on usability testing and feedback.


## Final Steps

1. Review the project breakdown with your team.
2. Set up initial brainstorming and role assignments.
3. Organize tasks in Linear or a similar tool.
4. Start building and iterating!
